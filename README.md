## A more realistic starfield


</div>

### Description

This is a fairly good starfield which has a couple of features like speed, roll and amount of stars (100-10000) in it. The effects work best in the dark as the stars are all single pixels and sometimes you may even get a little motion sickness from it too. :D
 
### More Info
 
Cursor UP/Down: Amount of Speed

Cursor Left/Right: Amount of Roll

Page Up/Down: Amount of Stars

Some dizziness perhaps.. :p
